High-frequency EEG covaries with spike burst patterns detected in cortical neurons.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive recording of the changes in the
human brain activity.  The low-frequency EEG - first described by Berger in
1929 - reflects summed synaptic inputs to a given cortical area. Since most
synaptic inputs fail to trigger spikes - the main output of cortical processing
- EEG says little about how active the neurons are. For example, inhibition and
exciation may produce similar EEG responses, but they have an opposing effect
on the total activity of the neural network.  Standard EEG methods are,
therefore, of limited use in monitoring neuromodulatory, feedforward, and
feedback effects on neural processing.

EEG also contains signals in a high-frequency range (> 400 Hz) that
offer temporal resolution that is sufficient to catch short-lived action
potentials. Unfortunately, high-frequency EEG is of such a small amplitude that
it has been long neglected as measurement noise. More recently several studies
have identified high-frequency EEG oscillations generated within the primary
somatosensory cortex and the thalamus in response to direct nerve and natural
sensory stimulation, or emerging spontaneously prior to epileptic discharges.
Combined invasive extracellular and EEG recordings in non-human primates
confirmed the neural origins of this EEG: Neurons localized in the primary
somatosensory cortex respond to median nerve stimulation with a burst of
two or more spikes whose timing matches the peaks in the high-frequency EEG.
This coupling between average single-cell and hf-EEG responses suggests that
the EEG components reflect either synchronous spikes or ultrafast
postsynaptic potentials.

In light of these findings, high-frequency EEG is the only currently available
non-invasive measure of neuronal spiking in human subjects.  Our goal is to
show that high-frequency EEG can also monitor spikes at the single-neuron
level. To this end, we study the trial-to-trial variability in the timing of
spikes and demonstrate their co-variation with concomitant high-frequency EEG,
validating EEG as a noninvasive probe for cortical spike output.
